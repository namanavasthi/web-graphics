# Intro to WebGL, GLSL and Three.js

Playing around with web graphics to see what it has to offer. Got inspired by a [Google IO talk from May 9, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2JzIUIHIhc&t=555s). I know it's 2020 but better late than never. Anyways, so I ended up on Frontend masters again for help and found a great course by [Matt DesLauriers](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/webgl-shaders/) and this is pretty much that course work.
